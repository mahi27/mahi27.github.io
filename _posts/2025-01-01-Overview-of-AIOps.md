<h2><strong>What is AIOps</strong></h2>
<p>Let’s talk about something that might just be the future of IT operations. No, it’s not the latest language or framework or yet another leetcode blind playlist. I’m talking about <strong>AIOps</strong>.
<br>
“Great, another buzzword to add to the already overflowing AI list!” That was my first thought when I heard AIOps. But as I started digging deeper into what AIOps really is, I began to see just how much potential it has to change the way we handle IT operations.
</p>

<p>AIOps stands for <strong>Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations</strong> - it is all about using AI and machine learning to help IT teams monitor, detect, and fix problems in real-time. Essentially, it acts like a smart assistant that keeps an eye on your infrastructure, analyzing vast amounts of data to spot issues before they turn into major problems.</p>

<h2><strong>How does AIOps actually work?</strong></h2>
<p> Complexity of modern systems can feel overwhelming. Between servers, networks, applications, and the constant stream of alerts, it's easy to get buried in data. Unless you have a massive IT team and 24/7 support, it's almost impossible to keep track of everything in real-time. That's where AIOps steps in.</p>
<br>
Here’s how it works in a nutshell:
<ul>
<li>Data Collection: AIOps pulls data from all kinds of sources—logs, monitoring tools, servers, and apps. It takes everything in, analyzes it, and starts looking for patterns.</li>
<li>Event Correlation: If you’re getting hit with a flood of alerts, AIOps can connect the dots between them. It can identify the root cause of an issue, even when the alerts are all over the place.</li>
<li>Anomaly Detection: AIOps can actively monitor your systems and flag anything that seems out of the ordinary. It’s an early warning system in place, spotting potential issues before they escalate </li>
<li> Automated Remediation:  When AIOps detects an issue, it doesn’t just notify you—it can also take action on its own. Whether it’s restarting a service or triggering a workflow, AIOps reduces the need for manual intervention.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Ops Landscape</strong></h2>
<p>Here’s a quick comparison that outlines the differences between the Ops -  AIOps, DevOps, MLOps, and DataOps: </p>
